# ConnectionLab_project1
### Initial Ideas: 
1. create a distorted / hard to read framework (it does not require much of "design elements" tbh)
2. commercial page / use it for self-promotion for sure

### Bit of research (of course
interactivityï¼š

   "banjo music studio" This is one of the websites I encoutered at work that had really impressed me. The interface itself introduces a fun experience of
   making good sound and literally anyone can use the interface to make nice melody.

   protfolio site from my undergrad instructor Hirad Sab <br />
   click into the top "gutter" section, a little puzzel game, feels like arranging a gallery
   the UI deisgn once mouse over any project title


### wireframe sketches_1

I want the interface to look like a puzzle.(or just a puzzle game maybe?) <br />
First entry, user will get bunch of blured boxes. User then need to click and drag the boxes to organize them in colunms and rows. Once the boxes are arrayed, a focused pattern will appear.<br />
a "reset" buttom on the right down borner might also be needed.
